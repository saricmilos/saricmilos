## Hi there, I'm Milos 👋

I’m a **Data Scientist** specializing in **neural networks**. I grew up in Serbia wandering the slopes of Ovčar and Kablar and mountains, exploring their quiet monasteries and hidden caves. Those mountains shaped the way I see the world.  

Here you’ll find my projects, Jupyter notebooks, and tutorials related to machine learning, data science, and engineering applications.

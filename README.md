## Hi there, I'm Milos 👋

I’m a **Data Scientist** specializing in **neural networks**. I grew up in Serbia wandering the slopes of Ovčar and Kablar mountains, exploring quiet monasteries and hidden caves. Those mountains shaped the way I see the world.

🚀 I'm currently doing research on AI, neural networks, and storytelling.  
🧰 I build useful tools for everyone to enjoy!  
📚 I write a lot — you can explore my projects and stories on my website: [saricmilos.com](https://cassiopeiai.com/)  
🎥 I create YouTube content and try to inspire the world with positive ideas.  
🎓 I studied Machine Learning and Power Systems Engineering at FTN NS and ETSEIB BCN, which shaped many of my thoughts on teaching and learning.  
🌍 Fun fact: In my third year of university, I went to Barcelona for a 3-day vacation… which turned into a year-long trip around the world and eventually led me to move to Barcelona — and that’s why I'm here now.

I'm best reached via email at saricmilos@cassiopeiai.com. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations.

Here you’ll find my projects, Jupyter notebooks, and tutorials related to machine learning, data science, and engineering applications.
